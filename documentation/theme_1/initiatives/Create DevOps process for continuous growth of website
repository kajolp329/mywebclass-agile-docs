Constraints: 
1.	Budget constraints: Implementing a robust DevOps process may require investment in tools, infrastructure, and resources. Budget limitations may limit the ability to invest in the necessary tools and personnel to effectively implement a DevOps process.
2.	Resource constraints: Implementing a DevOps process may require the involvement of multiple teams, including development, operations, and quality assurance. Resource constraints, such as limited availability of personnel, may impact the ability to implement the DevOps process effectively.
3.	Time constraints: Implementing a DevOps process can be a time-consuming process and may require significant time and effort to set up and configure the necessary tools and infrastructure.
4.	Technical constraints: The specific technical requirements of the project may impose constraints on the DevOps process, such as compatibility issues between tools or limitations of the infrastructure.
5.	Regulatory constraints: Compliance with industry or regulatory standards, such as HIPAA or PCI DSS, may impose constraints on the DevOps process and require additional resources and controls to be implemented.


Assumptions: 
1.	Stakeholders buy-in: It is assumed that all relevant stakeholders, such as development, 
operations, and quality assurance teams, are on board with the idea of implementing a DevOps 
process and understand the benefits it can provide.
2.	Availability of necessary tools: It is assumed that the necessary tools and infrastructure, 
such as version control systems, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools, and 
monitoring solutions, are available and can be integrated into the DevOps process.
